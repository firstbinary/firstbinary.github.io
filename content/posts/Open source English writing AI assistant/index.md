To be honest, most of the world's population does not speak English as their first language. Still, English has grown to be the most widely used language for communication across borders. This is a significant problem since, especially in professional contexts, communication gaps can happen when your native language affects your English.  
I want to highlight a company addressing this issue: **[Manara.tech](https://manara.tech)**. While their *Professional English* course is tailored for software engineers, itâ€™s open to everyone. Programs like this are a step forward, but I believe scaling solutions requires technology.

One way I believe can change this for  more people, is by having am AI writing assistant. Imagine a tool that helps you craft clear, concise English messagesâ€”whether for emails, reports, or collaborative projects. This could democratize effective communication for non-native speakers.  

Take **Deepseek**, for example. It performed exceptionally well on English benchmark exams, even tackling questions designed for PhD-level students. The example below shows how it assists in refining an article:
