AI distillation is an intresting concept. And I have tried to improve on my prompt engineering. I have a sytem where if i want to get the best out of deepseek , i ask the other older models like chatgpt to create a prompt for me. I take the prompt and paste it into deepseek. prompt engineering hack 101. 

Over time I have seen patterns ofhowto create a good prompt.

Below you can see the two steps to follow:

1.Ask ChatGpt or  Claude to make a good prompt.

2. Give the prompt to deepseek Ai and to Qwen Ai

paste the prompt again ,if not satisfied with the results.
